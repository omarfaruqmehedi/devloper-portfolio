            <p>In Harrys world fate works not only through powers and objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat,
                wands,
                and
                the Goblet of Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, other characters decide Harrys future for him,
                depriving him of freedom and choice. For example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control
                Harrys
                life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding of his identity (Sorcerers 49). In Harry
                Potter
                and the Chamber of Secrets, Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Rons and
                Hermiones

            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a
                paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality,
                though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
                defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).
                Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in
                some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
                Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout,
                we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the
                paragraph.</p>
